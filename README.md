## A weekly Technology and Development stream
By M_Ravenmoore

### The Goals

I aim to keep my self active in the comunitiy and doing at least a little code or technology related things each week while looking for work and being a dad.

so to that end i am producing a once a week stream that will start at the verry begging of building out a machine to develop on to builing parts of applications or websites just for fun. and more.

The first few streams will be aimed at Getting a machine up and running and then builind a simple express server that can act as our root for future projects and will be expandable.
